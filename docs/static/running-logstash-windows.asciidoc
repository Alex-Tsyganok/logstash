== Running Logstash on Windows (Work in progress)
Before reading this section, see <<installing-logstash>> for basic installation instructions to get you started.

Logstash is not started automatically after installation. How to start and stop Logstash on Windows depends on whether you want to run it as a service (with nssm), schedule it as a task, or run it manually.

[[running-logstash-windows-validation]]
=== Validating JVM Pre-Requisites on Windows
After installing a https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_jvm[supported JVM], open an Administrative https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/[PowerShell] session and run the following commands to verify `JAVA_HOME` is set and the Java version:

==== `Write-Host $env:JAVA_HOME`
** The output should be pointed to where the JVM software is located, for example:
```
`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.3`
```

** If `JAVA_HOME` is not set, perform the following:
*** Right click My Computer and select Properties.
*** On the Advanced tab, select Environment Variables
*** In the Environmental Variables window edit JAVA_HOME to point to where the JDK software is located, for example: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.3`

==== `Java -version`
** This command produces output similar to the following:
```
java version "11.0.3" 2019-04-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.3+12-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.3+12-LTS, mixed mode)
```

Once you have validated JVM pre-requisites, you may proceed.
